                Municipalities,
                and Code for NL enter into a strategic alliance in the field of

                We do this to develop innovative policy, with the aim of improving it

                We are building an active data science and AI community,

            <p class="headline">
                We have selected 3 open source solutions that provide the service
                to improve and accelerate citizens. We want to investigate together how
                these can be scaled up from Amsterdam to other municipalities.
                Rotterdam, Utrecht, and others have already signed up for this.
                Participation is possible on three levels (see below).
            </p>
            <p class="headline">
                We will do all the knowledge, data, and methods that result from these solutions
                share with other municipalities and governments in the Netherlands for recycling.</p>

                We are looking for municipalities that actively participate in (one of) the three projects.

                on behalf of the municipality, and that it actively participates on the weekly
                cooperation day.
